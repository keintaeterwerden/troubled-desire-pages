            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      
  
      <p>We, the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin (PROVIDER; for further detail see <a mprint">Imprint</a>) take the protection of your personal data very seriously and adhere strictly to the rules of the data protection laws. Personal data is collected on this website only to the extent technically necessary. In no case will the data collected be sold or otherwise disclosed to third parties. We also oblige all of our external service providers to comply with the same standards.</p>
<p>Please note that any form of data transmitted over the Internet (for example, when communicating via e-mail) may be vulnerable to interception. For technical reasons, a complete protection of the data from access by unauthorized third parties is generally not possible. We make every effort to protect your data in the best possible way.</p>
<p>The following statement explains how we warrant the protection of your data and what kind of data we collected and for what purposes.</p>

            <h2>Personally identifiable information</h2>
      
  
      <p>Personally identifiable information is every kind of information that can be linked to the personal and material circumstances of a specific or identifiable natural person. This includes information such as your name, home address, postal address, telephone number. Information that is not linked to your identity (such as the number of people using this website) is not included. Under rare circumstances a very unique combination of not personally identifiable information can be linked to your identity. Please be aware of that when providing non personally identifiable information!</p>
<p><strong>Generally, you can use our online service without revealing your identity.</strong></p>

            <h2>Information Processing on this Website</h2>
      
  
      <p>The PROVIDER does not save Server Log Files, i.e. information sent from your browser. IP addresses are not saved and solely used for geo-localization. When using the program, anonymized data is generated and collected. This data is used for the technical functionality of the program, the content feedback function of the program, quality control, the dissemination of the program (online/offline), statistical evaluation and scientific research. <br>No personally identifiable data is collected for this purpose.</p>
<p><br>For the content management of Troubled Desire, we use the WCMS Contao. The following page types are used: Home Page, simple page containing text, image, video and audio content and an online survey allowing for personal feedback on sexual preferences and problematic sexual behavior.</p>
<p>If the user starts a new session, it is stored under a randomly generated cryptic ID. This ID is displayed to the user at any time. Only through this ID can the user gain access to the entered data again. For each cryptic ID, in addition to the answers given to the questions in the online survey, the following data is stored: country as determined from the IP address (the IP address will not be stored), progress of the online survey, date and time of first access to the online survey and date and time of last change and last access to the online survey. The Session-ID will be automatically deleted after 3 months without access and will not be accessible or reclaimable again.</p>
<p>Please be aware that your answers in the online session might contain personally identifiable information. Depending on the information you provide (especially for open-ended question), your answers may suffice to make you personally identifiable. You can prevent that by omitting any names, dates, facts or any other unambiguously personal details in your written responses. You do not need to provide any personally identifiable information to take the survey. Your omission of any personally identifiable information has no influence on the quality of our response.</p>
