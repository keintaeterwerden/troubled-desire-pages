      <p>A well-researched technique to relax, calm down and examine ourselves is body scan. Body scan is like a journey through the body. We explore the body by moving our awareness to different body parts. By deliberately scanning each part, we perceive without judging our own thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations.</p>
<p>With some training, body scan helps us to simply stay with pleasant <em>and</em> unpleasant sensations, thoughts or emotions without fighting against or indulging them. At the same time, body scan enhances the ability to bring our attention to the present moment without being distracted by thoughts of the past or the future.</p>
<p>Aren’t these great excuses to lay down and relax?</p>
<p>At the beginning, body scan can be very demanding because we sometimes have too much going on in our heads. With some practice it will become easier, so please don’t worry!</p>
