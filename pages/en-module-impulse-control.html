          <h1>Impulse control</h1>

      <p>All humans are impulsive to varying degrees, but some more than others. The main features of impulsivity are impatience, rapid and unplanned reactions and reduced concern for the long-term consequences of actions – expressed succinctly by the adage “act first, think later.”</p>
<p>Impulsivity is not always bad. Impulsive people can easily take advantage of unexpected opportunities, effortlessly put their thoughts into words and quickly adapt to changes. Finding a balance is what matters.</p>
<p>Impulse control prevents impulsivity from dominating our actions. Poor impulse control becomes a problem when we feel unable to manage our behaviours or control our moods, leading to problems with our family, friends or at work.</p>
<p>Poor impulse control can also lead to dangerous behaviour, such as excessive gambling or committing sexual offenses. Research has found that paedophilic men with a history of sexual offenses against children exhibit inferior impulse control compared to paedophilic men without a history of sexual offenses against children.</p>
<p>It is important to understand when being impulsive is and is not appropriate, and to use this awareness to make the right choices.</p>
<p>Here are some tips and tricks on how to control your impulses and resist temptation:</p>

            <h3>Abstract thinking</h3>
      
  
      <p>Ask yourself <em>why</em> you should not act on an impulse (abstract) instead of <em>how</em> you could avoid acting on it (concrete).</p>
<p>Research has shown that thinking abstractly (<em>why</em> questioning) about our goals helps us to control our impulses. That is because when we ask ourselves <em>why</em> we tend to think of our actions as one piece of a larger puzzle. Our mind then finds it easier to stay focused and even associates temptations with negativity, as they are not part of the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Example: Should I watch television or go for a walk?</p>
<p><em>Why</em> should I go for a walk?</p>
<ul>
<li>I am often stressed. Open air is refreshing and relaxing.</li>
<li>I have been thinking about adopting a healthier lifestyle for a long time. A walk is definitely good for my health.</li>
<li>I want to expand or strengthen my social network. When I am outside I might meet some friends or acquaintances, or even meet new people.</li>
</ul>
<p>What about watching television instead? No! That doesn’t get me anywhere.</p>
<p>And the <em>how</em> questioning?</p>
<p><em>How</em> should I not watch television?</p>
<ul>
<li>I will need a lot of will power.</li>
<li>It sounds like a lot of deprivation.</li>
</ul>
<p>What about a walk instead? Is it really necessary?</p>
<p>When we ask <em>why </em>we tend to see going on a walk in a positive light and watching television in a negative light. When we ask <em>how</em> it is the other way around.</p>

            <h3>Rewards</h3>
      
  
      <p>When we connect our long-term ambitions with regular rewards it becomes easier to fight temptation.</p>
<p>In order to achieve our long-term goal of a peaceful and respectful life we can more easily stay on course by rewarding ourselves every time we resist urges, such as watching child abuse material.</p>
<p>Try to think about what is rewarding for you - perhaps a piece of chocolate or a visit to the cinema?</p>

            <h3>Tackle your stress level</h3>
      
  
      <p>When we are stressed we give in to temptation more often. That is because when we are stressed we are – and especially our brain’s reward system is – searching for rewarding stimuli, which are often consumed at the expense of long-term goals.</p>
<p>Body scan can be a valuable tool to relax yourself when you are stressed. If you are not already acquainted with the practice, please go to <em>Take a break </em>to learn more.</p>
