      <p>To train your self-perception you only need a pencil, a sheet of paper and a special focus on your inner processes.</p>
<p>Whenever you deal with everyday situations related to your sexual interest in children, please document your experiences and learn how they are affecting you. This can be either situations in which you are in contact with children or situations where you have sexual fantasies that relate to children without them being present at that moment.</p>

            <h4>Make notes about</h4>

<li>The situation (who, where, when)</li>
<li>Thoughts</li>
<li>Feelings</li>
<li>Bodily sensations</li>
<li>Behaviour</li>
<li>Urge of committing a sexual abuse (sexual assault or using child sexual abusive images)</li>
<li>Consequences (positive/negative)</li>

      <p>Any event, whether big or small, can trigger unfavourable thoughts and feelings. With the help of the regular note-taking, you will begin to discover recurring patterns. After a few weeks, you will become more experienced with your notes.</p>
<p>Consequently, you will learn to anticipate potential unfavourable behaviour and intervene at an early stage.</p>
