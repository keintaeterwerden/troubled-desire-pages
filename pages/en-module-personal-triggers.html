      <p>You are the master of your own decisions. You are in a position of deciding against urges and have probably made this decision several times before.<br>Have you ever had the impression that the urge to act on your sexual fantasies related to children gets stronger when you are in an unpleasant emotional state like angry, lonely or sad?<br>Have you ever had the impression that the urge to act on your sexual fantasies related to children gets stronger when you are in certain situations, such as when you are alone or passing by a playground?<br>What factors influence your decision? In which moments is it harder and when is it easier to stay strong?</p>
<p>You need to identify your triggers in order to prevent fantasies from becoming behaviour.</p>
<p>There are two types of triggers: internal and external.</p>
<p><strong>Internal triggers</strong> are inside yourself and are invisible to others. For example, unpleasant feelings such as anger, fear, hopelessness or loneliness.</p>
<p><strong>External triggers</strong> are outside yourself and may be perceived by others as well. For example, when you are talking to a child.</p>
<p>What might be your personal internal triggers?</p>
<p>What have been your personal external triggers?</p>
