We also oblige any external service providers to comply with these measures.</p>

A complete protection of the data from access by unauthorized third parties is generally not possible for technical reasons. We make every effort to protect your data in the best possible way.</p>

    <h2>Information Processing on this Website</h2>
    <p>The PROVIDER does not save Server Log Files, i.e. no information sent from your browser. IP addresses are not saved and solely used for geo-localisation.</p>
    <p>For content management of Troubled Desire, we use the web CMS Contao. The following page types are used: Home Page, simple page containing text, image, video, and audio content, and an online survey used for personal feedback on sexual preference and problematic sexual behavior on the site and for research purposes. No personally identifiable data is collected for this purpose.</p>
    <p>If the user starts a new session, it is stored under a randomly generated cryptic ID. This ID is displayed to the user at any time and only allows access to the entered data again under this ID. For each cryptic ID, in addition to the answers given to the questions in the online survey, the following data is stored: country, determined from the IP address, (IP address will not be saved) progress of the online survey and date and time of first access to the online survey, date and time of last change and last access to the online survey – the Session-ID will be automatically deleted after 3 months without access.</p>
    <p>The legal basis for the processing of information is Article 6, § 1, P.1 lit. f. GDPR. The eligible interest of the PROVIDER to collect data is listed above as purpose for information processing. Never will the PROVIDER use collected data for the purpose of drawing conclusions to you as a person. For the PROVIDER, the data can in no way to be connected to any particular user/person.</p>
